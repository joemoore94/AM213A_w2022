\paragraph{1.}
	\subparagraph{$\bullet$}
		We can show that a positive definite matrix can be written as lower triangular matrix multiplied by its conjugate transpose. We end up with the equations 2.82 and 2.83. We've seen before how $Ax = b$ can easily be solves with substitution if $A$ is triangular. Using this fact we have
    	\[
    	A^TAx = A^Tb = \tilde{A}x = \tilde{b} = LL^*x = \tilde{b}.
    	\] 
    	Then we solve $Ly = \tilde{b}$ for $y$ and then $L^*x = y$ for $x$ which is the solution to our original equation.

    	The resulting equation for the third degree polynomial fit is 
    	\[
    	f(x) = 1.83 - 5.17x + 11.2x^2 - 7.28.
    	\]
    	The 2-norm of the resulting error $E = ||b - Ax|| = 6.98\cdot10^{-6}$. Below is the resulting fitted curve.

    	The resulting equation for the fifth degree polynomial fit is 
    	\[
    	f(x) = 1.87 - 7.25x + 28.8x^2 - 58.7x^3 + 71.0x^4 - 25.2x^5.
    	\]
    	The 2-norm of the resulting error $E = ||b - Ax|| = 2.84\cdot10^{-5}$. Below is the resulting fitted curve.

    \subparagraph{$\bullet$}
    	single precision floats only store numbers from $10^{-38}$ up to $10^{38}$. When values carry essential information up to the sixth significant digit then being raised to anything over the fifth power will result in a lose of information. 
    	
    	From my code I found that fitting a curve up to the sixth degree polynomial resulted in significant error.
